\section{Valve Closing with Piping PDEs} \label{sec: PDE}

Assuming that the temperature remains constant, the density is only a function of the pressure. Additionally, $p = a^2 \rho$ from $\frac{p}{\rho}$ being constant and $\diff{p}{\rho} = a^2$. This allows a PDE describing the fluid behaviour which is identical to in~\cite{Hos2015ModelPipe} of

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    \pdiff{p}{t} + v \pdiff{p}{\eta} + \rho a^2 \pdiff{v}{\eta} &= 0 \\
    \pdiff{v}{t} + v \pdiff{v}{\eta} + \frac{1}{\rho} \pdiff{p}{\eta} &= \lambda \frac{L}{D} v \left| v \right|
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
