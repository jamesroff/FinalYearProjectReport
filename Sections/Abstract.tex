Instabilities which occur for direct spring-operated pressure relief valves are well researched and understood. However, little work is present on the instabilities of the more complex pilot-operated pressure relief valves. A set of differential equations describing the main piston and tank pressure dynamics are derived, and the Navier-Stokes conservation of mass and momentum equations are simplified for a slightly compressible fluid. Then, a model reduction is performed, considering only the acoustic quarter-wave. The reduced order model is used to calculate an analytical stability boundary for when chatter is believed to occur. This stability boundary is compared to a numerical continuation of the Hopf bifurcation associated with chatter. Finally, numerical simulations of the quarter wave model are performed, demonstrating stable operation, flutter and chatter instabilities.
